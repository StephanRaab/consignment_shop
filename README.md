# Consignment Shop Demo

Create an application thatn can be used by consignment shops to run their business. You need to know who the individuals/vendors are who have items in the shop and you need to associate these vendors with their items. Each vendor should be assigned a standard commission, but that may need to be changed on a per-vendor basis. The application should track how much should be paid to each vendor as well as how much money should be paid to th store
